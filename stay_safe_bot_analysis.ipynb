      "9. Elevate or floodproof mechanical units, furnaces, water heaters, electrical systems, and other utilities at least 12 inches above the BFE.\n",

We work hard to provide a home and a future for ourselves and our loved ones. Why risk losing it when bad weather hits close to home? \\nFlooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States \\nand can happen anywhere. Just one inch of water can cause $25,000 in damages to your home. \\nWhile you can\\u2019t prevent a natural disaster from happening, there are ways to secure \\nyour property to minimize damage and keep your home and your future safe. \\nFirst, determine the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) for your home. The \\nBFE is how high the water is expected to rise during fooding in high risk areas. You need to know your BFE because it is used in foodplain management regulations in your community that could affect your home for example, how high above the BFE a home or other building should be built. Your local foodplain manager can help you fnd this information. If you need help fnding your foodplain manager, contact FEMA\\u2019s Flood Mapping and Insurance eXchange\\n a\\nt FEMAMapSpecialist@ \\nr\\niskmapcds.com or (877) FEMA MAP (1 877 336 2627). \\nThe following are some additional steps you can take to protect yourself and your property against foods. \",\n",

Clear your gutters, assess drainage issues, or collect water in rain barrels. \\nANCHOR FUEL \\nTANKS Anchor any fuel tanks to the pad to prevent them from tipping over or foating in a food. Spilled fuel could become a fre hazard. Make sure vents and fll-line openings are above the BFE. Note: This may require permission from your fuel provider. \\nFLOODPROOF WALLS Add water-resistant exterior sheathing on walls and seal them to prevent shallow fooding from damaging your home. Cover openings below the BFE and seal all exterior openings around pumping and equipment. \\nSECURE \\nMANUFACTURED \\nHOMES If you have a manufactured home and you want food insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program, your home must be affxed to a permanent foundation so that the wheels and axles do not support its weight and resist fotation, collapse, or side-to-side movement. Your local foodplain manager can help you understand the requirements, and a professional engineer or architect can make sure the anchoring system is designed and installed correctly. REMEMBER: \\nSome of these tips may work better together than \\nothers. Mitigation measures need to be tailored to your property. Also, not all of these options work together, so talk with an expert who can help you identify which options work best for you. \\nAlways consult professionals such as your insurance \\nagent, architects, engineers, contractors, or other experts in design and construction before making changes to your home. Your local planning and zoning offce or building department is a good place to start for advice. \\nFinally, be kind to your neighbors! Talk to adjacent \\nproperty owners before you make changes, since some actions on your property may affect theirs. \",\n",

EL\\nEVATE UTILITIES \\nABOVE THE BFE Elevate or foodproof mechanical units, furnaces, water \\nheaters, electrical systems, and other utilities on masonry, concrete, or pressure-treated lumber at least 12 inches above the BFE. \\nREPLACE CARPETING \\nWITH TILES Tiles are more food-resistant than carpet. Using tile or other food-resistant materials in areas below the BFE can help reduce water damage. \\nFLOODPROOF \\nBASEMENTS If you have a basement, minimize damage by foodproofng your basement and sealing walls with waterproofng compounds. Consider installing a sump pump. \\nINSTALL FLOOD \\nVENTS Install food vents in foundation walls, garages, and other enclosed areas to allow water \\nto fow through, drain out, an\\nd lower the risk of \\nstructural damage. \\nUSE FLOOD-RESIST\\nANT \\nINSULATION & DRYWALL Fl\\nood-resistant insulation and drywall will help minimize \\ndamage and can be easily cleaned and sanitized. \\nPREVENT SEW\\nAGE \\nBACK-UP I\\nn some areas, fooding can cause sewage to back \\nup through drain pipes in your home. Consult with a plumber and, if applicable, invest in a sewer backfow valve to prevent this potential health hazard.
