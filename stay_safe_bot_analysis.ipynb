We work hard to provide a home and a future for ourselves and our loved ones. Why risk losing it when bad weather hits close to home? \\nFlooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States \\nand can happen anywhere. Just one inch of water can cause $25,000 in damages to your home. \\nWhile you can\\u2019t prevent a natural disaster from happening, there are ways to secure \\nyour property to minimize damage and keep your home and your future safe. \\nFirst, determine the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) for your home. The \\nBFE is how high the water is expected to rise during fooding in high risk areas. You need to know your BFE because it is used in foodplain management regulations in your community that could affect your home for example, how high above the BFE a home or other building should be built. Your local foodplain manager can help you fnd this information. If you need help fnding your foodplain manager, contact FEMA\\u2019s Flood Mapping and Insurance eXchange\\n a\\nt FEMAMapSpecialist@ \\nr\\niskmapcds.com or (877) FEMA MAP (1 877 336 2627). \\nThe following are some additional steps you can take to protect yourself and your property against foods. \",\n",

Consider taking photos of \\nhigh-value items or doing a video walkthrough of your \\nho\\nme to document its contents. \\nGET FLOOD \\nINSURANCE Most homeowners insurance \\npolicies don\\u2019t cover food damage. \\nProtect your investment by purchasing food insurance for your home and contents, even if you do not live in \\na hi\\ngh-risk food zone. \\nSTORE \\nVALUABLES Store valuables and important documents in waterproof or wa\\nter-resistant containers above the BFE \\n(preferably on an upper foor). Make copies and store them online or offsite. For more \\ninformation on purchasing food insurance through the National Flood \\nInsurance Program, visit \\nFlo\\nodSmart.gov  or contact \\nyour agent to get coverage. EL\\nEVATE UTILITIES \\nABOVE THE BFE Elevate or foodproof mechanical units, furnaces, water \\nheaters, electrical systems, and other utilities on masonry, concrete, or pressure-treated lumber at least 12 inches above the BFE. \\nREPLACE CARPETING \\nWITH TILES Tiles are more food-resistant than carpet. Using tile or other food-resistant materials in areas below the BFE can help reduce water damage. \\nFLOODPROOF \\nBASEMENTS If you have a basement, minimize damage by foodproofng your basement and sealing walls with waterproofng compounds. Consider installing a sump pump. \\nINSTALL FLOOD \\nVENTS Install food vents in foundation walls, garages, and other enclosed areas to allow water \\nto fow through, drain out, an\\nd lower the risk of \\nstructural damage. \\nUSE FLOOD-RESIST\\nANT \\nINSULATION & DRYWALL Fl\\nood-resistant insulation and drywall will help minimize \\ndamage and can be easily cleaned and sanitized. \\nPREVENT SEW\\nAGE \\nBACK-UP I\\nn some areas, fooding can cause sewage to back \\nup through drain pipes in your home. Consult with a plumber and, if applicable, invest in a sewer backfow valve to prevent this potential health hazard. DID YOU KNOW? \\nWhen following National Flood \\nInsurance Program regulations, \\nv\\nents can also help lower \\ninsu\\nrance rates. \\n\",\n",

When a home is properly elevated, the lowest foor should be above the BFE. Areas below the BFE can be used for parking, storage, or access to the house.

Clear your gutters, assess drainage issues, or collect water in rain barrels. \\nANCHOR FUEL \\nTANKS Anchor any fuel tanks to the pad to prevent them from tipping over or foating in a food. Spilled fuel could become a fre hazard. Make sure vents and fll-line openings are above the BFE. Note: This may require permission from your fuel provider. \\nFLOODPROOF WALLS Add water-resistant exterior sheathing on walls and seal them to prevent shallow fooding from damaging your home. Cover openings below the BFE and seal all exterior openings around pumping and equipment. \\nSECURE \\nMANUFACTURED \\nHOMES If you have a manufactured home and you want food insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program, your home must be affxed to a permanent foundation so that the wheels and axles do not support its weight and resist fotation, collapse, or side-to-side movement. Your local foodplain manager can help you understand the requirements, and a professional engineer or architect can make sure the anchoring system is designed and installed correctly. REMEMBER: \\nSome of these tips may work better together than \\nothers. Mitigation measures need to be tailored to your property. Also, not all of these options work together, so talk with an expert who can help you identify which options work best for you. \\nAlways consult professionals such as your insurance \\nagent, architects, engineers, contractors, or other experts in design and construction before making changes to your home. Your local planning and zoning offce or building department is a good place to start for advice. \\nFinally, be kind to your neighbors! Talk to adjacent \\nproperty owners before you make changes, since some actions on your property may affect theirs. \",\n",

Residents and busines ts owners in coastal areas are at risk from storm surge which the National Oceanic and \\nAtmospheric Administration defined as  \\u201can abnormal  rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the \\npredicted astronomical tide .\\u201d On the other hand, residents living and working adjacent to rivers face a \\nsignificant risk from river flooding caused by significant rainfall or snowmelt. To determine if your home or \\nbusiness is in  a flood zone, visit:  https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home  and enter your home\\u2019s address.  \\nTo learn more about flood mapping and to understand your risk, see this link:  \\nhttps://www. floodsmart.gov/why/all -about -flood- maps .  \\n \\n2. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or higher) are possible within \\na specified area. A Hurricane Watch is issued 48 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical -storm-\\nforce winds in an area. A Hurricane Warning, on the other hand, means that hurricane conditions (sustained \\nwinds of 74 mph or higher) are expected within a specified area. Because hurricane preparedness activities \\nbecome difficult once winds reach trop ical storm force  (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph), the hurricane \\nwarning is issued 36 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical -storm -force winds to allow for \\nimportant  preparation.  \\n \\n3. Place sand bags in areas that are most at risk from  flooding. Before hurricane season, try to elevate mechanical  \\ndevices  (i.e. air conditioners, generators, circuit breakers) to minimize the risk of impact by storm  surge. See \\nthe Homeowner\\u2019s Guide to Retrofitting for how to protect your home from flooding: https:/www.fema.gov/media -library/assets/documents/480\\n  \\n \\n4. A central meeting point should be established prior to a hurricane watch or hurricane warning being issued, so \\nthat if the power does go out, people know where to meet up with their loved ones. Another necessity is having \\na Go -Kit which, at the very minimum, should include water (one gallon per person, per day) and/or water \\npurification tablets, a first -aid kit, a flashlight, batteries, a hand-crank/solar powered radio, non-perishable \\nfood, cash (in small denominations), a wrench (to turn off utilities), hand sanitizer, a mylar blanket, ear plugs, \\nand a book and/or deck of  cards.  \\n \\n5. Make sure to have items and services in place before a hurricane watch or warning is issued. If a loved one is \\ncomforted by a certain item (a blanket, photograph, stuffed animal, etc.), be sure to pack the item when \\nevacuating. If a relative requires regularly scheduled mental health therapy, make sure  that his/her mental \\nhealth  provider is aware of the location of the  shelter.  \\n \\n6. Critical documents should be stored in Ziploc bags and kept in a safe place. Another option is to keep critical \\ndocuments stored on a cloud drive, on a flash drive kept in an alternate location, or in a safety deposit  box. \\n \\n7. Create a Go -Kit for your pet with essential items, including food, water, medication and favorite toys (if \\napplicable). Include your veterinarian\\u2019s contact information and be sure that your pet is microchipp ed or at \\nleast has ID tags displayed. Your local Office of Emergency Management should be able to help you determine \\nwhich shelters will accommodate pets during an evacuation.  \\n \\n8. Many coastal areas have predetermined coastal evacuation routes which are ident ified by blue signs. If \\npossible, familiarize yourself with the route by driving through it and determining the location to which it  \\nleads.  Evacuating to a friend or relative\\u2019s home outside of the expected landfall area allows you to minimize \\nthe risks associated with any impending hurricane or flood damage.  \\n \\n9. Communicating via text messaging is a good way to contact one another should phone lines and cellular towers \\nget damaged. Another option to consider is utilizing social media to get in contact with fam ily and friends. \\nThis includes Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.  \",\n",

      "8. Install highly visible street signs and property addresses to help firefighters and other emergency responders quickly find your property.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Seal gaps around openings in exterior walls and roofs with fire-resistant caulk, mortar, or fire-protective expanding foam.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Cover exterior attic vents and under-eave vents with metal wire mesh no larger than 1/8 inch to keep embers out.\n",

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected within a specified area and is issued 36 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Take actions around your house to help reduce the impact of a flooding event. This could include placing sand bags in areas that are most at risk from flooding and elevating mechanical devices like air conditioners, generators, and circuit breakers to minimize the risk of impact by storm surge.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Establish a central meeting point so that if the power does go out, people know where to meet up with their loved ones.\n",

      "Question: \n",
      "I am planning ahead: Como preparar minha casa para enchentes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Existem vÃ¡rias maneiras de preparar sua casa para enchentes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Tenha um plano de emergÃªncia: Crie um plano de emergÃªncia para sua famÃ­lia e pratique-o regularmente. Quando uma tempestade se aproxima, evacue e mova seu carro para um terreno mais alto.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Obtenha seguro contra inundaÃ§Ãµes: A maioria das apÃ³lices de seguro residencial nÃ£o cobre danos causados por inundaÃ§Ãµes. Proteja seu investimento comprando seguro contra inundaÃ§Ãµes para sua casa e seu conteÃºdo.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Prepare ou atualize uma lista do conteÃºdo da sua casa: Documente seus pertences. Isso lhe darÃ¡ tranquilidade e ajudarÃ¡ no processo de seguro se vocÃª precisar fazer uma reclamaÃ§Ã£o.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Armazene objetos de valor: Armazene objetos de valor e documentos importantes acima do BFE (preferencialmente em um andar superior). Coloque-os em recipientes Ã  prova d'Ã¡gua ou resistentes Ã  Ã¡gua.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Eleve aparelhos e utilidades acima do BFE: Mantenha aparelhos e utilidades como aquecedores de Ã¡gua, lavadoras, secadoras e painÃ©is elÃ©tricos em andares mais altos. Isso pode evitar que sejam danificados ou arruinados pela Ã¡gua da enchente.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Use materiais resistentes a inundaÃ§Ãµes: Isolamento resistente a inundaÃ§Ãµes, drywall e revestimentos de piso como azulejos ajudarÃ£o a minimizar os danos e sÃ£o mais fÃ¡ceis de limpar e higienizar.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. ConheÃ§a sua propriedade e vizinhanÃ§a: Se vocÃª estÃ¡ se mudando para perto de um grande lago ou do oceano, converse com os vizinhos. Descubra quaisquer problemas que eles tiveram ou quais medidas de mitigaÃ§Ã£o eles tomaram.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Eleve sua casa: Embora seja um investimento, elevar sua casa prepara sua propriedade contra inundaÃ§Ãµes e reduz os prÃªmios de seguro contra inundaÃ§Ãµes.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Proteja os itens do seu quintal: Itens inseguros podem ser levados ou danificados pelas Ã¡guas da enchente. Eles tambÃ©m podem ser levados para dentro de sua casa, causando danos.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Selo rachaduras e lacunas: Verifique o calafetagem ao redor das janelas e portas para garantir que nÃ£o esteja rachado, quebrado ou faltando. Preencha quaisquer buracos ou lacunas ao redor de tubos e fios que entram em seu prÃ©dio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lembre-se, sempre consulte profissionais, como seu agente de seguros, arquitetos, engenheiros, empreiteiros ou outros especialistas em design e construÃ§Ã£o, antes de fazer alteraÃ§Ãµes em sua casa.\n",

Residents and busines ts owners in coastal areas are at risk from storm surge which the National Oceanic and \\nAtmospheric Administration defined as  \\u201can abnormal  rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the \\npredicted astronomical tide .\\u201d On the other hand, residents living and working adjacent to rivers face a \\nsignificant risk from river flooding caused by significant rainfall or snowmelt. To determine if your home or \\nbusiness is in  a flood zone, visit:  https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home  and enter your home\\u2019s address.  \\nTo learn more about flood mapping and to understand your risk, see this link:  \\nhttps://www. floodsmart.gov/why/all -about -flood- maps .  \\n \\n2. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or higher) are possible within \\na specified area. A Hurricane Watch is issued 48 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical -storm-\\nforce winds in an area. A Hurricane Warning, on the other hand, means that hurricane conditions (sustained \\nwinds of 74 mph or higher) are expected within a specified area. Because hurricane preparedness activities \\nbecome difficult once winds reach trop ical storm force  (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph), the hurricane \\nwarning is issued 36 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical -storm -force winds to allow for \\nimportant  preparation.  \\n \\n3. Place sand bags in areas that are most at risk from  flooding. Before hurricane season, try to elevate mechanical  \\ndevices  (i.e. air conditioners, generators, circuit breakers) to minimize the risk of impact by storm  surge. See \\nthe Homeowner\\u2019s Guide to Retrofitting for how to protect your home from flooding: https:/www.fema.gov/media -library/assets/documents/480\\n  \\n \\n4. A central meeting point should be established prior to a hurricane watch or hurricane warning being issued, so \\nthat if the power does go out, people know where to meet up with their loved ones. Another necessity is having \\na Go -Kit which, at the very minimum, should include water (one gallon per person, per day) and/or water \\npurification tablets, a first -aid kit, a flashlight, batteries, a hand-crank/solar powered radio, non-perishable \\nfood, cash (in small denominations), a wrench (to turn off utilities), hand sanitizer, a mylar blanket, ear plugs, \\nand a book and/or deck of  cards.  \\n \\n5. Make sure to have items and services in place before a hurricane watch or warning is issued. If a loved one is \\ncomforted by a certain item (a blanket, photograph, stuffed animal, etc.), be sure to pack the item when \\nevacuating. If a relative requires regularly scheduled mental health therapy, make sure  that his/her mental \\nhealth  provider is aware of the location of the  shelter.  \\n \\n6. Critical documents should be stored in Ziploc bags and kept in a safe place. Another option is to keep critical \\ndocuments stored on a cloud drive, on a flash drive kept in an alternate location, or in a safety deposit  box. \\n \\n7. Create a Go -Kit for your pet with essential items, including food, water, medication and favorite toys (if \\napplicable). Include your veterinarian\\u2019s contact information and be sure that your pet is microchipp ed or at \\nleast has ID tags displayed. Your local Office of Emergency Management should be able to help you determine \\nwhich shelters will accommodate pets during an evacuation.  \\n \\n8. Many coastal areas have predetermined coastal evacuation routes which are ident ified by blue signs. If \\npossible, familiarize yourself with the route by driving through it and determining the location to which it  \\nleads.  Evacuating to a friend or relative\\u2019s home outside of the expected landfall area allows you to minimize \\nthe risks associated with any impending hurricane or flood damage.  \\n \\n9. Communicating via text messaging is a good way to contact one another should phone lines and cellular towers \\nget damaged. Another option to consider is utilizing social media to get in contact with fam ily and friends. \\nThis includes Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.  \",\n",

Clear your gutters, assess drainage issues, or collect water in rain barrels. \\nANCHOR FUEL \\nTANKS Anchor any fuel tanks to the pad to prevent them from tipping over or foating in a food. Spilled fuel could become a fre hazard. Make sure vents and fll-line openings are above the BFE. Note: This may require permission from your fuel provider. \\nFLOODPROOF WALLS Add water-resistant exterior sheathing on walls and seal them to prevent shallow fooding from damaging your home. Cover openings below the BFE and seal all exterior openings around pumping and equipment. \\nSECURE \\nMANUFACTURED \\nHOMES If you have a manufactured home and you want food insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program, your home must be affxed to a permanent foundation so that the wheels and axles do not support its weight and resist fotation, collapse, or side-to-side movement. Your local foodplain manager can help you understand the requirements, and a professional engineer or architect can make sure the anchoring system is designed and installed correctly. REMEMBER: \\nSome of these tips may work better together than \\nothers. Mitigation measures need to be tailored to your property. Also, not all of these options work together, so talk with an expert who can help you identify which options work best for you. \\nAlways consult professionals such as your insurance \\nagent, architects, engineers, contractors, or other experts in design and construction before making changes to your home.

      "Answer:\n",
      "Kuna hatua kadhaa unazoweza kuchukua ili kulinda nyumba yako dhidi ya mafuriko:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Elekeza Maji Mbali na Majengo: Hakikisha eneo lako linaelekea mbali na majengo kwenye mali yako na kwamba maji yana mahali pa kumwagika. Safisha mifereji yako, tathmini masuala ya mifereji ya maji, au kukusanya maji katika mapipa ya mvua.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Nanga Mizinga ya Mafuta: Nanga mizinga yoyote ya mafuta kwenye pedi ili kuzuia kuzunguka au kuogelea katika mafuriko. Mafuta yaliyomwagika yanaweza kuwa hatari ya moto. Hakikisha kuwa matundu ya uingizaji hewa na ufunguzi wa mstari wa kujaza yako juu ya BFE (Base Flood Elevation). Kumbuka: Hii inaweza kuhitaji ruhusa kutoka kwa mtoa huduma wako wa mafuta.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Kinga Kuta dhidi ya Mafuriko: Ongeza sheathing inayostahimili maji kwenye kuta na uzibane ili kuzuia mafuriko ya kina kifupi kuharibu nyumba yako. Funika ufunguzi chini ya BFE na ziba ufunguzi wote wa nje karibu na pampu na vifaa.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Thibitisha Nyumba Zilizotengenezwa: Ikiwa una nyumba iliyotengenezwa na unataka bima ya mafuriko kutoka kwa Programu ya Bima ya Mafuriko ya Kitaifa, nyumba yako lazima iwe imewekwa kwenye msingi wa kudumu ili magurudumu na axles zisitoe uzito wake na kuzuia kuelea, kuanguka, au harakati ya upande kwa upande.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Kumbuka: Baadhi ya vidokezo hivi vinaweza kufanya kazi vizuri pamoja kuliko vingine. Hatua za kupunguza madhara zinahitaji kubinafsishwa kwa mali yako. Pia, sio chaguo zote hufanya kazi pamoja, kwa hivyo ongea na mtaalamu anayeweza kukusaidia kutambua chaguo zipi zinafanya kazi vizuri kwako.\n",

      "Yes, you should be concerned about floods if you live next to a brook. Flooding can happen anywhere and is not limited to high-risk areas. Heavy rainfall or poor drainage can cause flooding, especially in low-lying areas. It's important to take steps to protect your home, such as elevating your home, securing yard items, and ensuring proper drainage.

Most homeowners insurance policies donât cover flood damage, so it's important to protect your investment by purchasing flood insurance for your home and its contents. This is recommended even if you do not live in a high-risk flood zone.
